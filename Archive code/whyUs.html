  We use a decentralized cloud storage network to store data. What this means is 
that data stored through our website will be encrypted, and sent to computers around the world.
This ensures that your data will not be lost.

  Centralized cloud storage services such as Amazon Web Services, ICloud, and Microsoft Azure
   store data in large facilities which require protection, maintenance, and air
    conditioning. Decentralized cloud storage stores data on the hard drives of 
    volunteers around the world. Data can be stored much more cheaply this way. Additionally, 
    Store-A-Byte is built for the average consumer, who doesn't need complicated features
    such as those provided by AWS, Wasabi, and Microsoft Azure. This allows us to 
    lower costs for our customers even further.
